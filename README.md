# WORDCHAIN
Word Chains
===========
Development process
===================

How did I get to my solution ?  It's all about covergence.  I start out and see where it goes, see what ideas pop up as I go along, see what sticks etc.  My general approach is as follows:

1) Write Tests - this gets me thinking about how should I represent the data, and helps drive the interface.
2) Start writing code
3) Get to a working solution (it's not always pretty at this point!)
4) Refactor Refactor Refactor until I hit a universal truth ie. the code becomes so simple it must be true!

To solve a problem I generally have a series of insghts - by this I mean ideas which seems obviously the right thing to do and possibly are a deep truth of the solution.
